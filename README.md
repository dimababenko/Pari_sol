# Pari_sol
Pari problem solving on Solidity contracts

# Example:
Bob and Marti have a pari - Marti should do 20 pushups today. 
If Marti wins - Bob should pay him 1 ETH (will be 0.9 because 10% will be givetn to virifiers addresses).

Verification should be done by at least of 3 validators (separate wallets).
